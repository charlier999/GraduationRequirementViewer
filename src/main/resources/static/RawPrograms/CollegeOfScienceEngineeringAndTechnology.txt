Bachelor of Science in Biology for Secondary
Education (IP/TL)
(Initial Program–Leads to Initial Teacher Licensure)
This program is offered by the College of Science, Engineering,
and Technology in conjunction with teaching licensure
requirement courses provided by the College of Education for
students who are preparing for a teaching career in grades 7-12
and who are seeking initial teacher licensure. The format and
courses of this regionally accredited and Arizona-approved
program are designed to maximize the content knowledge that
the teacher candidate will possess upon graduation. All courses
are directly aligned with Interstate Teacher Assessment and
Support Consortium (InTASC) principles. Content courses are
aligned to the standards of the National Science Teachers
Association (NSTA). Opportunities are provided to apply
concepts, theories, and research throughout the program.
Assessments within many of the courses guide students through
85 hours of practicum/field experiences prior to student teaching,
and the final semester of the program requires a full-time, 16-
week student teaching component. Applicants to the program are
responsible for contacting their state department of education for
licensure requirements and program approval. Arizona or home
state fingerprint/background clearance is required for all
practicum/field experiences and student teaching. Furthermore,
applicants should consult the Grand Canyon University Catalog,
the University Policy Handbook, and an academic counselor to
obtain information regarding current policies and procedures
inherent in a teacher licensure program.

Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science
The Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science is designed for
students who are interested in analyzing or collecting and
processing biological evidence related to various types of legal
and other investigations. The emphasis builds on a solid
foundation of biology and chemistry, and provides additional
training in criminal investigation, forensic biology, forensic
human pathology, serology, and forensic DNA analysis. The
program provides excellent preparation for graduate work in
specialized areas of forensics. Forensic science students receive
extensive training in the collection and analysis of biological
evidence in both lab and field settings. Students learn how to
evaluate mock crime scenes and how to document, collect, and
analyze the biological evidence to establish the time and cause of
death. With the rapid advances in biology, and because of the
precision of the science, courts are apportioning greater weight to
forensic evidence. Employment growth in state and local
governments should be driven by the increasing application of
forensic science techniques—such as DNA analysis—to
examine, solve, and prevent crime. This has created a critical
need for personnel with specialized training in the field.
Individuals who earn a bachelor's degree may seek employment
in various private or public forensic science and conventional
analytical laboratories. Students with sufficient work experience
could eventually qualify for positions as laboratory supervisors,
managers, or directors. Graduates will also find the program very
useful in pursuing future studies at the master or Ph.D. level.

Master of Science in Software Engineering
The Master of Science in Software Engineering prepares students
to work at any stage of the software development life cycle. This
contains eliciting project requirements, writing algorithms,
development, validating that the software is meeting its intended
purpose and verifying that it is safe, secure and dependable.
Software engineers concentrate on how a software project is
performing by being knowledgeable of software development life
cycles, different software development processes, estimation
techniques and measurement, and risk management. The primary
objective of this program is to prepare students to develop the
next generation of software products and services for consumers,
industry, and government. The curriculum includes
comprehensive, intensive coverage of modern software concepts
and techniques, and emphasizes a holistic approach
encompassing financial, legal, and presales issues; technical

Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering
Grand Canyon University’s Bachelor of Science in Industrial
Engineering was developed with industry guidance to address the
broad, foundational knowledge and skills required to meet or
exceed the expectations of employers in industrial engineering
and related fields, such as manufacturing, quality engineering,
systems design, project management, process improvement, and
supply chain management, including logistics, inventory control,
and distribution. This program teaches topics and assesses
competency in probability and statistics, human factors,
sustainable design, productivity analysis, lean work, and
automation for manufacturing and distribution. This program
integrates math, natural sciences, and computer programming
with an emphasis on critical thinking, problem solving, realworld application and practical project management experience.
The Christian worldview is integrated into the classroom,
preparing graduates to apply Christian principles of stewardship
and discipline with a commitment to professional and ethical
standards. BS in Industrial Engineering graduates enter the
workforce prepared to work in diverse teams, communicate
effectively, and pursue leadership roles and advanced learning.
