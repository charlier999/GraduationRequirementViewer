Bachelor of Arts in Dance for Secondary
Education (IP-TL)
(Initial Program - Leads to Initial Teacher Licensure)
The Bachelor of Arts for Secondary Education is a program
designed to prepare and certify candidates for the instruction of
Dance Arts in a secondary education environment. All courses
are directly aligned with the Interstate Teacher Assessment and
Support Consortium (InTASC) principles. The program spans
126 credit hours of instruction and practicum experience resulting
in a recommendation for an Arizona initial certificate to work in
the State’s schools. As part of the dance program’s
development, a council comprised of faculty from the College of
Education, the College of Arts and Media, and the College of
Arts and Sciences has been instituted. The relationship between
the College of Arts and Media and the College of Education
ensures student teachers will receive both content knowledge,
and the means to convey that knowledge in their classrooms.
Opportunities are provided to apply concepts, theories, and
research throughout the program. Assignments within many of
the courses guide students through 105 hours of observational
and practice-based experiences, and the final semester of the
program includes a full-time student teaching component. These
educational settings must be state-certified environments, and
mentor teachers must be fully certified. Graduates of this
program are prepared to become informed educators in public
and private schools and other settings requiring teaching
licensure. The program is designed to train dance educators and
practitioners by blending the theories and practices of dance and
its related fields. In addition to regular classroom studies, Dance
Education majors are required to participate in the Ethington
Dance Ensemble for our bi-annual concert series. Students serve
in numerous capacities, including onstage and offstage
disciplines, thus allowing them to explore the creative process
from rehearsal to live performance. This global approach to
dance education training creates a graduate who is multi-faceted
and prepared to succeed in today's marketplace.

The music department aspires to provide strong undergraduate
academic programs, multiple music performance opportunities,
and a welcoming environment where future musicians and music
educators are constantly challenged to greater levels of academic
and artistic achievement in order to achieve success in their

Each of these mission statements are reflected in the Missionbased Bachelor’s Competencies. These competencies are critical

Bachelor of Arts in Music with an Emphasis in
Piano Performance
The Bachelor of Arts in Music program is designed for
developing musicians who wish to devote themselves to
developing musical skills, understanding composition and
refining their performance skills. The program is a Bachelor of
Arts professional degree, aligned with the National Association
of Schools of Music (NASM) standards. The degree allows
participation in varied performing ensembles and studies, while
simultaneously preparing students for a variety of careers both
within and outside the field. Some students enter this program
with aspirations of teaching private lessons or owning their own
studio. Others wish to pursue their master‛s degree so they are
able to teach studio lessons or other music courses at the
collegiate level. Performance scholarships for program majors
and/or Pep Band members are available by audition and
interview. Students selecting the Bachelor of Arts in Music
program will need to determine whether they want to pursue an
instrumental, piano or voice emphasis, and a primary instrument
must be declared. Private instruction in an applied instrument or
voice is required. Additionally, in order to meet NASM
professional degree standards, the sixteen (16) elective credits
present within the program must be taken from a specified pool
of music-related electives. Adherence to this requirement will be
checked by the department at regular intervals as part of normal
progression through the degree. Integral to the Bachelor of Arts
in Music program at Grand Canyon University is the opportunity
for students to perform in public. Ensemble concerts and solo
recitals, as well as smaller chamber ensembles, are a staple of the
musical landscape at GCU. The music program, in conjunction
with the theatre program, produces the University’s Ethington
Theatre series, which presents a series of major productions

Bachelor of Arts in Digital Design with an
Emphasis in Animation
The Bachelor of Arts in Digital Design with an Emphasis in
Animation program prepares students to work as entry-level
designers in a variety of exciting industries that use motion
graphics including advertising, marketing, social media,
journalism, and corporate communications. Students learn the
design process, including concept development, visualization
techniques, stylistic trends, composition, typography, color
theory, image creation, and static and sequential composition
using industry standard motion graphics software. While building
all these skills, students create dynamic visual content in every
studio course. Motion graphics pervade digital advertisements,
social media videos, and brand experiences. The job
opportunities for students with these skills span all sectors of the
economy and will offer growth opportunities well into the future.
This is a 4-year, 120-hour, traditional campus or online liberal
arts program. The design education courses fall into three
categories: foundational creative and skill development, motion
graphics, and portfolio development. A mid-program portfolio
focuses on preparing students to pursue internships and the
fourth-year portfolio prepares students for employment and
continued education. Students are expected to make these
portfolios both industry ready and innovative in nature. Grand
Canyon University is committed to teaching students to think
critically and creatively about using their skills to improve and
enrich society. Throughout the program students develop their
communication, creativity, and problem-solving skills, because
GCU believes in the development of the whole student. Examples
of ethical leadership and the integration of a student’s faith with

Assignments within many of the courses guide students through
over 100 hours of observational and practice-based experiences,
and the final semester of the program includes a full-time, 15-
week student teaching component. These educational settings
must be state certified environments and mentor teachers must be
fully certified. Teacher candidates are responsible for contacting

and program approval. Furthermore, teacher candidates should
consult the Grand Canyon University Academic Catalog, the
University Policy Handbook, and an academic counselor to
obtain information regarding current policies and procedures
inherent in a teacher credentialing program. While completing a
