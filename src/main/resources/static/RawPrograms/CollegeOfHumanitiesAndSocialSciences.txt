practice and to apply that knowledge in a counseling setting.
With a master‛s in addiction counseling, graduates may be
prepared to own and operate their own counseling clinic or work

theory and practice; social and cultural diversity issues in
counseling; psychopharmacology theories of drug abuse,

emotional health, a foundational study of the integration of
counseling theory and Christian thought, and a study of spiritual
formation, thereby providing supplemental study of spiritual
growth for the counselor in life and practice.
A pre-practicum or supervised field work experience concludes
the program, under the supervision of a faculty member.
Following the pre-practicum, students take part in a supervised
practicum/internship experience to develop their counseling skills
and to perform all the activities that a regularly employed
professional counselor would be expected to perform in a
supervised setting.
