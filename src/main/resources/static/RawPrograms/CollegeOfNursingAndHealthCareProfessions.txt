Master of Public Health
Public health is a multidisciplinary and collaborative field of
study integrating the biological, social, psychological,
anthropological, political, and environmental sciences to improve
health outcomes among populations. There is a high demand for
trained public health professionals as a result of the increased
prevalence of chronic diseases, emerging and re-emerging
infectious diseases, environmental health concerns, trends toward
population health management in health care, health care reform,
and global health concerns. Grand Canyon University's (GCU)
Master of Public Health (MPH) program prepares graduates to
apply public health theories to relevant and emerging health
issues in order to develop, implement, lead, and evaluate health
promotion and disease prevention programs through collaborative
partnerships. The program prepares students for leadership
positions in state and local health departments, international
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health policy and
planning organizations, health care organizations, universities,
community-based education programs, and faith-based ministries
addressing public health issues. The curriculum combines core
subject areas like epidemiology, environmental health,
quantitative analysis and interpretation, health policy, social and
behavioral factors, planning, and evaluation with unique
applications to community engagement and health ministry. The
program culminates with a practicum and capstone project that
students are able to design based on their professional interest
area. The GCU MPH program is unique because the program
focuses on integrating Christian values, servant leadership, and
community engagement throughout the program.

Master of Science in Health Care Informatics
Health care informatics is a rapidly emerging discipline that
offers new frontiers requiring innovative leadership. As health
care reform begins to impact all areas of the health care system,
greater attention is being focused on the value of health
informatics in reducing health care costs, increasing access, and
improving the quality of health care services. Health care
informatics is quickly becoming vital to the growth and security
of the United States’ health care system. The integration of
information technology into health care and the continuous
changes in patient-care systems require professionals and leaders
with training in clinical operations, data management systems,
health care system operations, project management, decision
making, and quality assessment.
Graduates may perform a variety of functions for the
organization, such as automating clinical care, building new
operational data systems, training health care workers in the use
of computer systems, collecting and analyzing data to improve
patient care, etc. Depending on their areas of strength and focus,
graduates may serve as project managers, project designers,
researchers, systems analysts, or administrators and executives at
all levels of the organization. Graduates may work in a variety of
settings, including hospitals, primary care facilities, doctors’
offices, insurance companies, pharmacies, technology suppliers,
consulting firms, and more. Organizations of potential
employment include the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; National Institutes of Health; clinical data exchange
insurance sites; the government’s Military Health System
(hospitals); Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; state
health care; and informational technology vendors.
