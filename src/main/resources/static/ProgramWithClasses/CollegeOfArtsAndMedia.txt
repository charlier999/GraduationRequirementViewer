Bachelor of Arts in Dance for Secondary Education (IP-TL)
    (Initial Program - Leads to Initial Teacher Licensure) The Bachelor of Arts for Secondary Education is a program designed to prepare and certify candidates for the instruction of Dance Arts in a secondary education environment. All courses are directly aligned with the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) principles. The program spans 126 credit hours of instruction and practicum experience resulting in a recommendation for an Arizona initial certificate to work in the State’s schools. As part of the dance program’s development, a council comprised of faculty from the College of Education, the College of Arts and Media, and the College of Arts and Sciences has been instituted. The relationship between the College of Arts and Media and the College of Education ensures student teachers will receive both content knowledge, and the means to convey that knowledge in their classrooms. Opportunities are provided to apply concepts, theories, and research throughout the program. Assignments within many of the courses guide students through 105 hours of observational and practice-based experiences, and the final semester of the program includes a full-time student teaching component. These educational settings must be state-certified environments, and mentor teachers must be fully certified. Graduates of this program are prepared to become informed educators in public and private schools and other settings requiring teaching licensure. The program is designed to train dance educators and practitioners by blending the theories and practices of dance and its related fields. In addition to regular classroom studies, Dance Education majors are required to participate in the Ethington Dance Ensemble for our bi-annual concert series. Students serve in numerous capacities, including onstage and offstage disciplines, thus allowing them to explore the creative process from rehearsal to live performance. This global approach to dance education training creates a graduate who is multi-faceted and prepared to succeed in today's marketplace.
